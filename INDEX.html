            <h2>Overview of the Internet</h2>
            <p>The Internet, sometimes known as the World Wide Web, is a global network that links millions of computers worldwide. It has transformed communication, information exchange, and commerce, becoming an essential component of contemporary civilization.</p>

            <p>The Internet has advanced significantly over the years, including the development of hypertext markup language (HTML), which enabled the production of the first web pages, and the advent of the browser, which made traversing the online more user-friendly.</p>
